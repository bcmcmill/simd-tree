# SIMD-Tree

This repository offers a high-performance KD-tree data structure, optimized using Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations, implemented in Rust.

![Build Status Badge](BUILD_BADGE_URL)
![License Badge](LICENSE_BADGE_URL)

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **SIMD Optimization**: KD-Tree operations that leverage the power of SIMD instructions.
- **Memory Efficient**: Utilizes memory arenas to keep memory allocations to a minimum, leading to faster performance.
  
## Installation ðŸ“¦

1. **Add Dependency**:
   Include this in your `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    simd-tree = { git = "https://github.com/bcmcmill/simd-tree" }
    ```

2. **Use in Your Rust Project**:

    ```rust
    use simd_tree::{Node, Point, search, insert};

    let mut points: Arena<Node> = Arena::new();
    let root = insert(&mut points, None, [2.0, 3.0]);

    assert_eq!(search(&points, Some(root), [2.0, 3.0]), true);
    ```
